# Connect Four Game

### This project was done as a part of the Computer Science Career Path by Codecademy

## Project Description
#### This is a multiplayer game, implemented to be played on the terminal.
#### Two players take turn to drop coloured tokens inside of a grid (6x7).
#### Instead of using coloured tokens, I have used alphabets X and O to represent each player's token.

## What did I learn from this?
This project helped me get a good understanding of fundamentals of python. 
In this course I did a lot of guided projects in codecademy's environment.
Developing in my own system and without any guidance was surely challening.
This was a pretty basic terminal program but helped me a lot in logic building.
The main challenge was to develop an algorithm on how to check for a match
diagonally and vertically inside a 2-D list. For me that was the toughest part.
Felt about searching on google for this but held tight and eventually I 
figured it out myself.
Finishing this project within a day is definitely a good achievement for me.
Looking forward to build on this feat!
